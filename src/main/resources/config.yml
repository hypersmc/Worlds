# To start off i would like to thanks you very much for buying this plugin! This plugin has been in development for a very very long time.
# To start the plugin you will need the following requirements:
# 1. MySQL Database (options for SQLLite and others are coming)
# 2. A server with atleast 5 GB of ram. You can buy one at https://zennodes.dk/Buy/cart.php?gid=1&language=english
# 3. A very powerful server. A weak server would easily crash as of there is big schematics that can easily crash the server.
#
